# Overview

`CKAD` is a certification designed for Kubernetes Application Developers. The exam is 2 hours. Candidate needs to resolve multiple questions in 4 different k8s clusters using a browser based terminal.

I passed the exam with a score of 87% (66% is required to pass the exam). Below is what I find useful to me.

1. Exercise: https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises
2. Book: https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/#purchase-the-ebook
3. Reading: https://github.com/walidshaari/Kubernetes-Certified-Administrator/blob/master/README-ckad.md
4. [Kubectl reference](kubectl.md)
5. [Linux command reference](tip.md)

My overall experience is that time is very precious during the exam. I ran out of time and didn't finish 3 questions. Even though one can open a chrome tab to `kubernetes.io` subdomain, I highly recommend to memorize most concepts and commands because of time constrain.

In addition, most people reocommended using tmux and vim shortcuts, I didn't really need them.

Good luck!
