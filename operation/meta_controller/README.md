# MetaController


# Tips

* Whenever `Metacontroller` asks for a resource name, you should use the canonical, lowercase, plural form (e.g. replicasets).
* Kubernetes resources and kinds must have a 1-to-1 correspondence within a given API group, the resource name and kind are often used interchangeably in Kubernetes documentation. The kind is often the same as the singular resource name, except that itâ€™s written in UpperCamelCase.
